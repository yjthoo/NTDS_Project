# NTDS_Project

Originally done within the context of the course [Network Tour of Data Science](http://edu.epfl.ch/coursebook/en/a-network-tour-of-data-science-EE-558) edition 2017 at EPFL, this project explored the impact of the features of a given movie (such as its actors, budget, etc) on its success, i.e "What impacts the success of a movie?". This was done with [The Movies Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/rounakbanik/the-movies-dataset).

This enabled us with experience with Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, SciPy, PyGSP and NetworkX.
